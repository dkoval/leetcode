 * <a href="https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/february-leetcoding-challenge-2021/584/week-1-february-1st-february-7th/3626/">Trim a Binary Search Tree</a>
 * <p>
 * Given the root of a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries as low and high, trim the tree so that all its elements lies in [low, high]. Trimming the tree should not change the relative structure of the elements that will remain in the tree (i.e., any node's descendant should remain a descendant). It can be proven that there is a unique answer.
 * <p>
 * Return the root of the trimmed binary search tree. Note that the root may change depending on the given bounds.
