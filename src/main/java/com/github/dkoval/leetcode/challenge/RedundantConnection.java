 * <a href="https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/june-leetcoding-challenge-2021/606/week-4-june-22nd-june-28th/3791/">Redundant Connection</a>
 * <p>
 * In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.
 * <p>
 * You are given a graph that started as a tree with n nodes labeled from 1 to n, with one additional edge added.
 * The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to n, and was not an edge that already existed.
 * The graph is represented as an array edges of length n where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge
 * between nodes ai and bi in the graph.
 * <p>
 * Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of n nodes.
 * If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.
