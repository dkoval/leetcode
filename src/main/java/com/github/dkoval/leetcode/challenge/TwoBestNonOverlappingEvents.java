/**
 * <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/two-best-non-overlapping-events/">Two Best Non-Overlapping Events</a>
 * <p>
 * You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array of events where events[i] = [startTimei, endTimei, valuei].
 * The ith event starts at startTimei and ends at endTimei, and if you attend this event, you will receive a value of valuei.
 * You can choose at most two non-overlapping events to attend such that the sum of their values is maximized.
 * <p>
 * Return this maximum sum.
 * <p>
 * Note that the start time and end time is inclusive: that is, you cannot attend two events where one of them starts and
 * the other ends at the same time. More specifically, if you attend an event with end time t,
 * the next event must start at or after t + 1.
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>>2 <= events.length <= 10^5</li>
 *  <li>>events[i].length == 3</li>
 *  <li>>1 <= startTimei <= endTimei <= 10^9</li>
 *  <li>>1 <= valuei <= 10^6</li>
 * </ul>
