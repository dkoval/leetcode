 * <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-hire-k-workers/">Minimum Cost to Hire K Workers (Hard)</a>
 * <p>
 * There are n workers. You are given two integer arrays quality and wage where quality[i] is the quality of the i-th worker
 * and wage[i] is the minimum wage expectation for the i-th worker.
 * <p>
 * We want to hire exactly k workers to form a paid group. To hire a group of k workers, we must pay them according
 * to the following rules:
 * <ol>
 *  <li>Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.</li>
 *  <li>In the group, each worker's pay must be directly proportional to their quality.
 *  This means if a workerâ€™s quality is double that of another worker in the group,
 *  then they must be paid twice as much as the other worker.</li>
 * </ol>
 * Given the integer k, return the least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying the above conditions.
 * Answers within 10^-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>n == quality.length == wage.length</li>
 *  <li>1 <= k <= n <= 10^4</li>
 *  <li>1 <= quality[i], wage[i] <= 10^4</li>
 * </ul>
