/**
 * [Surrounded Regions](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/june-leetcoding-challenge/541/week-3-june-15th-june-21st/3363/)
 *
 * Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O)(the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.
 * A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.
 *
 * Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'.
 * Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'.
 * Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.
